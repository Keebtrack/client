# ðŸ›  react-webpack-starter
 React webpack starter pack ready for production and smooth development, it works with two basic commands, `npm start` to start running webpack dev server and `npm run build` this will build the entire project and minify, uglify everything. It includes Purifycss, this will remove any unused css from the code.
 
 In the alias section in the `webpack.config.js` file you find a line like this ` '@components': path.resolve(sourcePath, 'components')` make sure to add your redux store, graphQL schemas or any other paths here, it solves the issue of `../../../components/button` like imports.

This repo is made because the react create app CLI tool does not setisfy all of the requirements for a smooth developement flow and maximum minification for production builds. With this webpack config you have full controll over your environment. 

If you increase the complexity off the `webpack.config.js` I highly recommend making multiple webpack config files. One for the dev server and one for builds. The config is already 175 lines at this moment. The `.concat()`'s are ok but once getting bigger it can become messy.
